# Priscilla

Priscilla is my personal fork of Red that I use in my own servers. There isn't really anything different
between Priscilla and Red other than renaming Red to Priscilla. I offer her with no support or warranty to anyone
who wants to use her.

# Priscilla is a fork of [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)

# Disclaimer

Priscilla will now be rebased from the original Red repository whenever new commits are made. This decision was made for my convenience and in order to keep the commit log free of several merge commits. For anyone who has created a fork off of Priscilla, this means that in the future, it's possible that **you will no longer be able to cleanly merge from this repository**. The Priscilla fork was created for personal use and is offered with **no warranty whatsoever**. If these changes cause any inconvenience to you, then unfortunately I will be **unable to help you**.

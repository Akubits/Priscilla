# Priscilla

Priscilla is my personal fork of Red that I use in my own servers. There isn't really anything different
between Priscilla and Red other than text file changes. I offer her with no support or warranty to anyone
who wants to use her.

# Priscilla is a fork of [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)

This repo also contains a modified version of conversationgames from [Jintaku Cogs](https://github.com/Jintaku/Jintaku-Cogs-V3) with most
things that could be considered NSFW removed.
